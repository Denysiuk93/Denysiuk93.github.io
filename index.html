            Hello there, so happy to see you on my website. I am really excited
            to share my Travel Guide with you. Here I will share the countries that I have visited, or want to visit in a future.
            But before we dive in further into my Travel guide, it is important to discuss <cite>Why traveling is important?</cite>
          </p>
          <h1>Why Travel is Important</h1>
          <ul class="larger-bullets">
              <li class="left-align">Expands your perspective</li>

              <p class="text">Travel exposes us to different cultures, 
                traditions, and ways of life, fostering understanding, 
                empathy, and tolerance towards others.</p>
              <br>
              <li class="left-align">Creates memorable experiences</li>
              <p class="text">This is one of the top reasons why traveling is important! 
                Traveling abroad gives you the opportunity to create memories that will last a lifetime.
                From the new foods you will eat to the people you will meet and the places you will visit, 
                every experience will be unique and special.
                 Imagine the stories you’ll be able to share when you get back! </p>
              <br>
              <li class="left-align">Allows you to discover new cultures</li>
              <p class="text">Traveling abroad allows you to experience different cultures firsthand. 
                It can help you gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world and the people in it. 
                It can also help you become more open-minded, 
                tolerant, and accepting of different ways of life, and you will return home practically a new person!</p>
              <br>
              <li class="left-align">Encourages personal growth</li>
              <p class= "text">Traveling to a foreign country can be a challenging and transformative experience.
                 This is a big reason why travel is important.
                Being thrust into a way of life completely different 
                from what you know back home can push you out of your comfort zone,
                 help you develop new skills, and give you a sense of independence and self-reliance. 
                 It can also help you gain a better understanding of yourself and your place in the world.</p>
              <br>
              <li class="left-align">Reduces stress and promotes relaxation</li>
              <p class="text">Traveling abroad can also have a positive impact on your mental health. It can help you reduce stress and anxiety and 
                also can offer a sense of adventure and excitement. 
                Additionally, being in a new place can help you disconnect from your everyday life and give you a chance
                 to relax and recharge.
                Many companies now include paid gap years and increased paid time off for employees as they 
                have recognized why it's important to travel and how important 
                traveling is for people to stay at the top of their game at work. 
                Traveling is also a great way to prevent burnout—it cleanses your brain and allows you 
                to come back a stronger and more focused person.</p>

              >“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the
              only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great
              work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. 
              If
              you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all
              matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.” —Steve
