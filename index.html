              <p > Hello there, so happy to see you on my website. 
                I am really excited for you to get to know me a little. 
                Here I will share something about me, my life and what motivates me in life.

              <h3>Living the American Dream</h3>
              I moved to United Stated when I was turning 18. As a teenager I was really excited
              to visit USA. I have always wanted to see the country of my favourites celebrities.
              When if finally happened.
              It was a sureeal moment. A different continent, as  it seemed like 
              a total different world. Which it was at some point for me.

              By the age of 18, I haven't travel much, so going straight to  the USA, was like winning
              a Jackpot in slot machine. It felt like a dream.
